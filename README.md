# PhotoFrame
## Repo structure
```
- Code
  |- allTest_01
  |- test programs
- Photos to SD
```
- `Code` - folder containing test programs for the whole photoframe and test program used to test individual components
- `Photos to SD` - folder containing bitmaps of all photos that are gonna be displayed

## Photo setup
- 24bit bitmap
- 320px height
- 240px width

## Credits
- code for displaying bitmaps is based on work of `Rarday` on adafruit forum ([link](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=141979)) but with slight modifications so it works
